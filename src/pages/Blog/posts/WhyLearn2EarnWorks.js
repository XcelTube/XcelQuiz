      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Learning is valuable — so why shouldn’t learners be rewarded? That’s the philosophy behind the Learn-to-Earn model powering XcelTube.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        In our model:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>🎁 Students earn XcelCoin for completing lessons & quizzes</li>
        <li>🔁 Those tokens can be used to unlock premium content or cash out</li>
        <li>🌐 Everything is built on Polygon blockchain (fast + low fees)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600">
        It's more than motivation — it’s a system that values growth. XcelTube is proud to pioneer this in education.
